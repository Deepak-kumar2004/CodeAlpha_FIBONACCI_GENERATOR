# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. It is part of the CodeApha internship task.

## Description

The script contains a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence and a main function to interact with the user. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Usage

1. **fibonacci(n)**: This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.
    - **Parameters**: 
        - `n` (int): The number of terms to generate.
    - **Returns**: 
        - A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.

2. **main()**: This function prompts the user to input the number of terms to generate and prints the resulting Fibonacci sequence.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command:
    ```
    python fibonacci.py
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of Fibonacci terms you wish to generate.

## Example

If the user inputs `5`, the script will output:
```
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 5
The first 5 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling:
- It checks if the input is a positive integer.
- It handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer inputs) by displaying an appropriate error message.
